Identify Merge Conflicts:
see the file in master branch then you will see both the data in a single file including branch
names that are dividing with conflict messages 
Resolve Conflicts:
open file in VIM EDITOR and delete all the conflict dividers and save it!
add git to that file and commit it with the command (git commit -m "merged and resolved the
conflict issue in abc.txt")
GIT REBASE: Git rebase is a Git command used to incorporate changes from one branch
into another. It allows you to re-organize and streamline the commit history by moving or
combining commits from one branch onto another.
